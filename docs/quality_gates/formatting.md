# Formatting

Technically no one has to format their code, it is cosmetic. 

Because so many linting tools have formatting rules, sometimes it easier
to format your code before running a linter over it.

## Bash formatting

### shfmt

This is a go tool.

### prettier

This is a nodejs tool, install the prettier-plugin-sh to format bash.

## Yaml formatting

### yamlfmt
yamlfmt is a go tool, so it pairs well with shfmt

### yamlfix

yamlfix is a python tool

### prettier

Prettier, again, can format yaml and pairs well with prettier and the prettier-plugin-sh.
